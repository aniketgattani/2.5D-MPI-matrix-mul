This is the github classroom template for COMP 422/534 assignment 3

Files:

  environment.sh:
     execute the following command to set up your environment for this assignment

     source environment.sh

  reduce_avg.cpp: a sample MPI program that contains some communication

  hello.cpp: a sample MPI hello world program that has no communication

  Makefile:
    a Makefile that includes recipes for building your program

        usage:

          make # builds three versions of the reduce_avg code
            # one with debugging symbols
            # one configured for MPI tracing 
            # one compiled with optimization for performance

          make EXEC=hello # builds three versions of the hello world code

          make view # views an execution trace with Jumpshot

Slurm scripts:

  submit.sbatch:
    a sample batch script that you can use to launch a batch job that will 
    execute an mpi program on a compute node

      usage:
          sbatch submit.sbatch

  interactive.sh: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    to run on a node in the interactive partition 

    usage:

      source interactive.sh


  reservation.sh: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    to run on a node in the interactive partition using the class 
    reservation

    usage:

      source reservation.sh

  any.sh: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    to run on any node 

    usage:

      source any.sh

To run an MPI program on the cluster with the default settings 
(number of ranks = number of nodes x ntasks per node):

srun ./<yourprogram>

To run an MPI program on the cluster with a specified number of ranks
(which must be <= number of nodes x ntasks per node):

srun -n <numranks> ./<yourprogram>
